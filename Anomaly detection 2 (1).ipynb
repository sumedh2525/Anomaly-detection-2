    " Role of Feature Selection in Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection by helping identify the most relevant features that contribute to the detection of anomalies. Irrelevant or redundant features can introduce noise and hinder the performance of anomaly detection algorithms. By selecting the most informative features, the algorithm can focus on distinguishing normal and anomalous patterns more effectively."
